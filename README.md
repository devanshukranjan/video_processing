# video_processing

 In this project I have imported libraries like: 
 tkinter for creating GUI, 
 cv2 for processing videos and creating frames, 
 os for processing files and creating directory, 
 shutil for copying file to a created directory, 
 random for generating random numbers, 
 PIL for working with jpg images.
 In this GUI window I have created buttons, labels, textbox, progress bar, separators and displayed image.
